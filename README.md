  **This repository serves as a storage (and a hosting) for a Javascript script that will automatically "Push Pixels" for you. Decided to make it open-souce unlike the previous ones, cuz, why not? At least for now...**

## What this script does:
* Clicks the button "Push Pixels"
* When your balance eventually reaches 1000 coins, it buys a double pixel upgrade
* When your balance eventually reaches 3000 coins (double pixel is profitable), it buys a triple pixel upgrade

# FAQ

### Q: Why does it buy upgrades? I may need those coins!
### A: If your goal is to earn cryptocurrency (TON), you must place as many pixels as you can, the so-called "Pixel Coins" currency only serves as an upgrade currency, not playing any role in the main idea of the game.

### Q: Why does it only buy 2x and 3x boosts?
### A: Because the other ones are not profitable. The 2x boost can give you around 120-130% of its price back, while 3x is just nice. And it doesn't cost much. So why not?

# Known Issues
* Sometimes the script can buy multiple boosts instead of just one (not intended)
