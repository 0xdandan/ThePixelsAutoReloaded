  **This repository serves as a storage for Javascript scripts that will automatically "Push Pixels" for you.**

# ⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️
Devs have stated that using an autoclicker OR a similar script is not safe! This probably means that those are now bannable. Use at your own risk.

## What this script does:
* Clicks the button "Push Pixels"
* When your balance eventually reaches 1000 coins, it buys a double pixel upgrade
* When your balance eventually reaches 3000 coins (double pixel is profitable), it buys a triple pixel upgrade

# FAQ

### Q: Why does it buy upgrades? I may need those coins!
### A: If your goal is to earn cryptocurrency (TON), you must place as many pixels as you can, the so-called "Pixel Coins" currency only serves as an upgrade currency, not playing any role in the main idea of the game.

### Q: Why does it only buy 2x and 3x boosts?
### A: Because the other ones are not profitable. The 2x boost can give you around 120-130% of its price back, while 3x is just nice. And it doesn't cost much. So why not?

# Known Issues
* ~~[v3.0] Bad timings, the script sometimes glithes out and stops working~~ (Fixed in v3.1)
* ~~[v3.1] Sometimes the script can buy multiple of the same boosts instead of just one on execution~~ (Fixed in v3.2)
   ~~- Quick fix: After the first boost is bought on script execution and the shop is opened again, quickly close the shop so the second boost isn't bought.~~
